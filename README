This tarball contains all the files needed to build a MIPS cross-compiler. It is based off of Cross Linux From Scratch
3.0 (http://clfs.org/view/CLFS-2.1.0/mips) along with a build script install-mips-cc.sh which itself is based off of
SESC's install-mips.sh, cleaned up and updated for CLFS 3.0 and a modern Linux system.

We assume an environment variable CLFS set to a working directory, i.e. /home/user/mipsroot:
$ export CLFS=$HOME/mipsroot

To download the relevant sources, run
$ wget -i dl-mips-cc.list -P ${CLFS}/sources

I've also included the patch files which should be included in the ${CLFS}/sources directory.

To run the build script, we first need to get some symbolic links ready. After creating ${CLFS}/tool and
${CLFS}/cross-tools directories, run as root:
# ln -sv ${CLFS}/tools /
# ln -sv ${CLFS}/cross-tools /

Run the following to get the build done in a clean environment:
$ env -i HOME=${HOME} TERM=${TERM} PS1='\u:\w$ ' CLFS=`pwd` ./install-mips-cc.sh
